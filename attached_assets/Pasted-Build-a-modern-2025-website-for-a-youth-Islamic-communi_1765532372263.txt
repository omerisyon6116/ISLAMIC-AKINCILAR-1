Build a modern 2025 website for a youth Islamic community called “AKINCILAR”.

STYLE & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Not minimal, not over-cyberpunk: find a balanced middle ground.
- Contemporary, energetic, respectful, youth-oriented.
- Avoid rainbow/neon overload and avoid corporate minimalism.
- Visual identity should feel powerful, inspiring, and culturally rooted.

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: deep navy / night blue
- Accent: warm gold / amber / copper
- Secondary accent: turquoise or emerald green
- Use gradients very subtly, never rainbow.
- Dark-light contrast sections for rhythm.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Strong modern sans-serif for headings (tech + human feel).
- Clean readable font for body text.
- Large bold hero typography with subtle text animations.
- Avoid gothic, gaming, or futuristic fonts.

LAYOUT & STRUCTURE:
- Hero section with bold slogan and animated text reveal.
- Smooth scroll-based section transitions.
- Sections:
  1. Hero (vision + movement)
  2. Who we are (mission, identity)
  3. Activities & events (cards with hover animation)
  4. Knowledge & content (articles, learning)
  5. Youth energy section (quotes, movement)
  6. Call to action
  7. Footer with clean symmetry

ANIMATIONS & INTERACTIONS:
- Use modern CSS animations:
  - text reveal
  - hover glow (very soft)
  - magnetic buttons
  - card lift on hover
- Inspired by modern CSS animation patterns (Prismic / CodePen style).
- Animations must feel smooth and premium, not flashy.

ISLAMIC / OTTOMAN INFLUENCE:
- Use subtle Islamic geometric patterns as background textures.
- No obvious icons like mosques or swords.
- Cultural depth through symmetry, geometry, and rhythm.
- Ottoman spirit through structure and balance, not decoration.

TECH STACK:
- HTML, modern CSS, vanilla JS (no heavy frameworks).
- Clean, readable, scalable code.
- Responsive for mobile first.
- Ready to be converted into WordPress later.

TONE:
- Youthful but serious.
- Energetic but dignified.
- Inspiring, not preachy.

DELIVERABLE:
- Complete homepage layout
- CSS animations included
- Clean modern UI
- Visually strong but balanced design
